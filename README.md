# Production Pipeline Notes

These notes summarize _Production Pipeline Fundamentals for Film and Games_ by Renee Dunlop. Given the scarcity of resources for those curious about production pipelines in the film and gaming industries, it is my hope that these notes are useful to those without access to Dunlop's book or who prefer the material presented succinctly.
