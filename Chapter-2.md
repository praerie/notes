# Chapter 2: The Stages of Production

## Section 2.1: What You Will Learn from This Chapter

The second chapter is a continuation from the previous introduction to production pipelines, exploring:

* an overview of the principal stages of a film or game project
* the challenges of film and game production
* production evolution and contingency planning
* the economics of production and financial pressures

## Section 2.2: The Economics of Film Production

### Cost

Movies are lucrative but risky. Major studios spend $50-250 million before marketing and distribution, which can add a further $100 million to the total.

On average:
* 65-75% of movies lose money for their investors,
* 15-20% break even,
* and 5-10% are profitable.

To control costs in this risky business, studios are incentivized to produce movies in states or countries that offer favorable tax conditions and lower labor rates. As a result, many VFX facilities have set up operations in these locations. 

However, much of the labor is outsourced and offshored. Given the industry's use of digital technology, work can be done anywhere in the world, providing that the equipment and qualified workers are available.

### Time

Making films is time-consuming, typically taking around 36 months or more, with its commercial value hinging on 2 critical days:  the film's opening weekend. 

Release dates are often set far in advance in order to gain competitive advantage over certain weekends, such as holidays or school vacations. With a target date in mind, production begins.

Although theoretically there should be enough time to complete the film, deadlines are short. The VFX department is the last major department to complete its work, so pressure to perform efficiently is enormous.

To keep on schedule and keep rates competitive, VFX facilities take measures including but not limited to:
* Developing a robust pipeline organized into tasks for maximum efficiency
* Communicating workflow expectations to those at the studio, artists, vendors, etc.
* Using a **Digital Asset Management (DAM)** system that enables management and project producers to view the status of various shots being produced
* Communicating status of shots to studio when required
* Maintaining all equipment
* Developing benchmarks for types of shots being produced to estimate time, resource, and cost requirements
* Tracking cost to complete shots against the bid to refine the bidding proccess, enabling facility to bid competitively for future work

## Section 2.3: The Economics of Game Production

### Demographics

The video game market has evolved to be quite diverse and sizable. Per the Entertainment Software Association, the average gamer "today" (_2014 at time of publishing_) is 30 years old and has been playing games for 12 years, and there are now more adult women playing games than boys aged 17 or younger. 

### Cost

The most expensive AAA&#185; game budgets rival those of the $100 million+ budgets of Hollywood blockbusters. The cost of marketing matches or in some cases eclipses that of development.

Costs rise with each successive generation of game consoles.

&#185;**AAA** (Triple-A) &mdash; informal classification used to classify video games produced and distributed by mid-sized or major publishers, typically with higher development and marketing budgets than lower tiers

### Market Landscape

_Success is the exception rather than the rule._ In response, many game developers and publishers have attempted to reduce risk by "rinsing and repeating" what has already worked in the market, leading to a plethora of sequels and a lack of innovation in game design. However, the lower end of the market is thriving, turning away from inflated development costs of console games and towards mobile, social, and browser games to find new audiences. 

Given the market diversity, it is difficult to generalize about the demands that economic factors place upon the development pipeline: AAA games require developers to manage large data sets, track complex production jobs, and control costs tightly, while indie titles require lightweight, agile pipelines permitting rapid innovation. 

## Section 2.4: The Stages of Production

Terminology used in live action films with CG enhancements, animated features, and games has evolved along different paths, sometimes resulting in homonyms that can cause confusion.

Main stages of film production:
* Pre-production
* Production
* Post-production

Main stages of game production:
* Pre-production
* Production
* Finalling

Post-production and finalling are where the film and game industries diverge the most: film strives to conform to a predefined storyline with a linear series of VFX shots, and games provide dynamic, interactive experiences with the game engine generating visuals in response to player input.
