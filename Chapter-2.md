# Chapter 2: The Stages of Production

## Section 2.1: What You Will Learn from This Chapter

The second chapter is a continuation from the previous introduction to production pipelines, exploring:

* an overview of the principal stages of a film or game project
* the challenges of film and game production
* production evolution and contingency planning
* the economics of production and financial pressures

## Section 2.2: The Economics of Film Production

### Cost

Movies are lucrative but risky. Major studios spend $50-250 million before marketing and distribution, which can add a further $100 million to the total.

On average:
* 65-75% of movies lose money for their investors,
* 15-20% break even,
* and 5-10% are profitable.

To control costs in this risky business, studios are incentivized to produce movies in states or countries that offer favorable tax conditions and lower labor rates. As a result, many VFX facilities have set up operations in these locations. 

However, much of the labor is outsourced and offshored. Given the industry's use of digital technology, work can be done anywhere in the world, providing that the equipment and qualified workers are available.

### Time

Making films is time-consuming, typically taking around 36 months or more, with its commercial value hinging on 2 critical days:  the film's opening weekend. 

Release dates are often set far in advance in order to gain competitive advantage over certain weekends, such as holidays or school vacations. With a target date in mind, production begins.

Although theoretically there should be enough time to complete the film, deadlines are short. The VFX department is the last major department to complete its work, so pressure to perform efficiently is enormous.

To keep on schedule and keep rates competitive, VFX facilities take measures including but not limited to:
* Developing a robust pipeline organized into tasks for maximum efficiency
* Communicating workflow expectations to those at the studio, artists, vendors, etc.
* Using a Digital Asset Management (DAM) system that enables management and project producers to view the status of various shots being produced
* Communicating status of shots to studio when required
* Maintaining all equipment
* Developing benchmarks for types of shots being produced to estimate time, resource, and cost requirements
* Tracking cost to complete shots against the bid to refine the bidding proccess, enabling facility to bid competitively for future work
