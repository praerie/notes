# Chapter 2A: Interlude: Previs and Related Data

### Definition 

**previs**&mdash;the process in pre-production of visually designing and planning scenes before the visual effects work begins

### Origin Story

Previs emerged in the 90s as a way to leverage high-end computer graphics hardware and software in the early stages of pre-production as a design and planning tool. 

Thanks to advances in hardware and software, previs has evolved from one or two artists working on a few shots to a highly specialized team comprising a dozen or more artists working for months on intricate animatics that replicate the action, look, mood, and tone of the film.

Previs allows filmmakers to engage in an *iterative design process*, testing which ideas work and which do not, before allotting time and resources to visual effects work.

### Basic Steps

Previs follows the same basic steps:
* create accurate, low-res assets of characters, sets, props, etc.
* animate the action
* add cameras to cover the action
* output the cameras by rendering
* edit coverage to create an animatic
* add sound effects
* review, revise, and repeat!

### Setup & Software

Previs teams must work in close proximity to creative decision makers and thus need to have easily movable setups in the case of travel.

A typical previs setup includes:
* a workstation for each artist (including a computer loaded with all necessary software and a library of models and animations),
* a shared server,
* a back-up drive,
* and networking hardware.

Larger previs teams also sometimes allocate a few additional workstations as render farms or editorial workstations.

Most feature film previs is created with **Maya**. Previs artists also use **Photoshop**, **Illustrator**, and video editing software. 

### Resource Gathering

Previs exists along the boundaries of a variety of departments, occupying a unique position within film production. To effectively reflect the specific circumstances that production will encounter during filming, the previs team needs to gather as much information as possible.

Breakdown of what previs gathers and from whom:
* Production (Director and Producer)
    * script pages
    * storyboards in physical and/or digital form
    * audio files for temp score or sound effects
* Art Department
    * concept art
    * reference images
    * location photos
    * dimensions for sound stages
    * 2D set designs in physical and/or digital form
    * 3D models of environments, props, vehicles, etc.
* Camera Department
    * camera specs for shooting (e.g. frame rate, aspect ratio, resolution)
    * camera aperture (film) or sensor size (digital)
    * complete list of lenses
    * details for any specific camera equipment (e.g. cranes, jib arms, cable cams, motion control rigs, etc.)
* Visual Effects
    * LIDAR data
    * 3D models of characters, creatures, environments, props, vehicles, etc. from VFX vendors 
    * matte paintings from VFX vendors
* Stunts
    * rehearsal footage
* Editorial
    * rough edits
    * principal photography plates
