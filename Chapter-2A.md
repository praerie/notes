# Chapter 2A: Interlude: Previs and Related Data

## Definition 

**previs**&mdash;the process in pre-production of visually designing and planning scenes before the visual effects work begins

## Origin Story

Previs emerged in the 90s as a way to leverage high-end computer graphics hardware and software in the early stages of pre-production as a design and planning tool. 

Thanks to advances in hardware and software, previs has evolved from one or two artists working on a few shots to a highly specialized team comprising a dozen or more artists working for months on intricate animatics that replicate the action, look, mood, and tone of the film.

Previs allows filmmakers to engage in an *iterative design process*, testing which ideas work and which do not, before allotting time and resources to visual effects work.

## Basic Steps

Previs follows the same basic steps:
* create accurate, low-res assets of characters, sets, props, etc.
* animate the action
* add cameras to cover the action
* output the cameras by rendering
* edit coverage to create an animatic
* add sound effects
* review, revise, and repeat!

## Setup & Software

Previs teams must work in close proximity to creative decision makers and thus need to have easily movable setups in the case of travel.

A typical previs setup includes:
* a workstation for each artist (including a computer loaded with all necessary software and a library of models and animations),
* a shared server,
* a back-up drive,
* and networking hardware.

Larger previs teams also sometimes allocate a few additional workstations as render farms or editorial workstations.

Most feature film previs is created with **Maya**. Previs artists also use **Photoshop**, **Illustrator**, and video editing software. 

## Resource Gathering

Previs exists along the boundaries of a variety of departments, occupying a unique position within film production. To effectively reflect the specific circumstances that production will encounter during filming, the previs team needs to gather as much information as possible.

Breakdown of what previs gathers and from whom:
* Production (Director and Producer)
    * script pages
    * storyboards in physical and/or digital form
    * audio files for temp score or sound effects
    * foreseeable difficulties and issues
* Art Department
    * concept art
    * reference images
    * location photos
    * dimensions for sound stages
    * 2D set designs in physical and/or digital form
    * 3D models of environments, props, vehicles, etc.
* Camera Department
    * camera specs for shooting (e.g. frame rate, aspect ratio, resolution)
    * camera aperture (film) or sensor size (digital)
    * complete list of lenses
    * details for any specific camera equipment (e.g. cranes, jib arms, cable cams, motion control rigs, etc.)
* Visual Effects
    * LIDAR data
    * 3D models of characters, creatures, environments, props, vehicles, etc. from VFX vendors 
    * matte paintings from VFX vendors
* Stunts
    * rehearsal footage
* Editorial
    * rough edits
    * principal photography plates

## Output 

Over the course of a production, previs creates thousands of individual shots and hundreds of edited sequences requiring terabytes of storage. 

| Type       | Format | Approx. Size |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Scene Files | MA | 500 GB |
| Movies | MOV | 250 GB |
| Diagrams | PDF | 100 MB |
| Keyframes | JPG, PDF | 100 MB |
| 3D Models | MA | 10 GB |

### Scene Files 

Action described in the script or storyboard is divided into sections, ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes, and then animated and saved as a Maya scene file. 

Each scene contains characters, creatures, props, environments, etc. comprising the essence of the action being described and cameras covering the action, ranging from a single camera to dozens. 

### Movies

For each camera contained in a Maya scene file, a Quicktime movie is output, referred to as a **shot**. 

These shots range in duration from a few frames to a minute or more and are edited together to create sequences ranging from a few seconds to over twenty minutes. Sound effects and temp scores are often added to help convey mood, tone, and emotion. 

The previs team makes revisions based on feedback from the filmmakers until the work is approved.

### Diagrams

Sometimes shots are represented as 2D diagrams in programs like Photoshop and Illustrator, serving as blueprints that describe:
* the location of the camera and its path of travel,
* distances, speeds, and positions of actors and vehicles,
* and any other relevant production data. 

### Keyframes

Edited sequences of shots are frequently reduced to a series of still frames, often posted on-set on large boards to guide the shooting schedule.

### 3D Models

As the project winds down, the previs team packages individual assets and complete scenes for delivery to various VFX vendors.
